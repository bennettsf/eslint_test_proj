1.	I began by initializing a new Node.js project by using npm init and following the procedure to create the package.json file. 
2.	Then I initialised eslint to the project using npm init @eslint/config. 
3.	I then edited some of the rules within the new eslintrc file that was created to only allow single quotes and always require semicolons. 
4.	After that I tested initializing a shared profile  and then ran eslint on my index.js file. As shown in the screenshot on my github repository readme, eslint caught a bunch of errors in my index.js file so I ran the --fix command and had those errors manually fixed. 

I ran into absolutely no issues and the installation was smooth. The linter caught errors correctly and fixed them accordingly. I feel that eslint can be extremely helpful when multiple people are working on a project and they each have their own coding habits whether or not they're syntactically correct. Eslint makes sure that the code is consistent to the projectâ€™s preferred standards.
